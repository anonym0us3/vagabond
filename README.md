## Awesome Vagabond Overview:

A travel community for all users to share city-specific tips (via posts) about their favourite locations around the world!



#### Prerequisites:

* A Rails >= 3.2 Application
* Ruby >= 2.0
* PostgreSQL database
* Active Record ORM
* RESTful design

##### Installation/QuickStart Guide:

Clone this repo. For help, please check out [this guide](http://bfy.tw/3qzM).

Add these lines to your gemfile if you do not already have them:

	gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
	gem "paperclip", "~> 4.3"

In order for the Paperclip gem to run, it requires ImageMagick. **Please follow the instructions at [ImageMagick's site](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip#requirements)**

If you forget to `bundle install` after that, you're going to Developer Hell and a puppy will die. **Do not be an asshole to puppies!**

*Starting the database*

`rake db:drop` and then `rake db:create db:migrate` to get the ball rolling. We've kindly supplied you with some basic seed data, or you can roll your own, so follow-up with `rake db:seed` .

Start your server in development mode and you'll now be able to access the site at `localhost:3000` to begin playing around. When you're ready to go big or go home, don't forget to precompile your assets and start your server in production mode.
